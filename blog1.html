                <h2>The Tesla Bot: Is AI going to kill the service sector?</h2>
                <small>August, 2021</small>
                <div>
                   <p>
                    The music starts and flashes of light engulf the room. Every photographer vying for a shot of the new AI bot in town. To everyone’s surprise the bot breaks character to pop-n-lock! Yup, you read that right, the bot goes on to dance. Giggles from around the room were heard as the human in the AI suit walks away leaving the stage to the man himself Shrimaan Elon Musk.
                   </p> 
                   <p>
                    It was the Musk show from here on. The obvious fake was actually a lifelike prototype of what can be expected around 2022. He can be quoted saying that “AI could have profound impact on the economy” whether positively or negatively is yet to be seen.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The features of the Tesla bot is modelled around the Tesla car which made sense as Tesla is the no.1 manufacturer and consumer of sensors, actuators and lead the way in terms of design and innovation optimizing batteries and increase spending in research in renewable energy and its applications.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The bot is most likely to eliminate “boring and repetitive” work. Dropping off mails, picking up groceries, cleaning the house or perhaps even cooking for you. The possibilities are endless. Tesla is planning to remove the word “Boring” from your life’s bokwaas dictionary and replace its meaning with the branding of his own – The boring company.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Impact of the bot once commercialised will inadvertently kill the service sector that rely on human resources to fulfil the boring jobs in the current world. People will be replaced by mechanical bots that work for free generating more revenue for industries but killing jobs at the same time.
                   </p>
                   <p class="blog-padding">
                    Predicting the future of what it’s like to have a life that has AI embedded in it is the same as trying to take a peek in a dark room looking for your glasses. What the Tesla bot brings to the table is yet to be seen.
