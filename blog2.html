                    Any job that doesn’t challenge you enough is doing a disservice to your time and effort. The gravity of this line is such that anyone being too comfortable at their jobs would stay up all night having it run through their mind again and again until they’ve hit the question “If not this then what else?”, “What Next?”

                    Well luckily for all of us we have a mentor who embedded this thought into the minds of students and learners in the first place. Learners irrespective of their background coming together under one roof calling themselves students of Tanay Pratap sir ;)

                    It was 2019, the results were out and I was in line with a piece of paper trying to find a job that came with the degree. Little did I realise that the promise of a job was never kept and I was left to fend for myself in the ocean of uncertainty.

                    I landed job in a leading CRO as a Data Manager. Alas!  I finally made it. That thought was engulfing my feelings with joy. A job in a service company is a stepping stone to a leading IT company, how wonderful! I thought to myself. A year had passed and when I looked back I realised that all I got to learn is how to handle process’s and raise tickets.

                    Monster.com was the place to visit again. But this time something had changed, the requirements tab for any role with a years’ experience had requirements I’d never heard of. The Mechanical degree came to no good use either. I gave up. Strapped myself to a long and tenuous life in a corporate world learning nothing and only gaining weight as I sit on the chair munching on my snack wondering “What next?”

                    It was around Jan 2021, I discovered a YouTube channel that taught students how to code and make projects at the same time. I made up my mind to try it. As I started learning coding the question that kept bugging me had seized to exist. The path started to become clearer. But! The time for submission was running out and I was still making my first project. I couldn’t make it. The NeoG camp 2021 did not have my name listed.

                   <p class="line-height">
                    Back at the same question “What Next?”. Buried myself in work to forget this, took up new roles in the team and landed a promotion all in a year and half. I believed this was it. If I keep doing this I’ll hopefully be a team lead someday -I thought to myself. But something was still missing. Everything was still comfortable and I had learnt nothing new.

                    I recalled the reference from Munna Bhai – “Phir Kya? …Apun ke mohalle mai Aishwarya Aaaayeee!”. The NeoG camp 2022 was announced! I was’nt going to miss out this time. Finished the Mark 9 projects and was ready to submit. Surprise! There are 5 more projects. The path was clear “if not this then nothing else”, In case you made it this far in the read you can find the remaining projects listed as well.

                   <p class="line-height">
                    It’s still uncertain if my name would be in the list of students vying for a spot in NeoG- 2022. But, one thing is for certain the learning never stops :)
